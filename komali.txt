The tax came into effect from 1 July 2017 through the implementation of the one hundred and First Amendment of the Constitution of India by the Indian government the GST replaced existing multiple taxes levied by the central and state governments.

HISTORY:
                     The reform of India's indirect tax regime was started in 1986 by Vishwanath Pratap Singh Finance Minister in Rajiv Gandhiâ€™s government with the introduction of the Modified Value Added Tax MODVAT Subsequently Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao and his Finance Minister Manmohan Singh initiated early discussions on a Value Added Tax  VAT at the state leveln  a single common "Goods and Services Tax GST" was proposed and given a go-ahead in 1999 during a meeting between the Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his economic advisory panel which included three former RBI governors ig Patel Bimal Jalan and C Rangarajan vajpayee set up a committee headed by the Finance Minister of West Bengal Asim Dasgupta to design a GST model.
The Asim Dasgupta committee which was also tasked with putting in place the back-end technology and logistics later came to be known as the GST Network or GSTN in 2015 It later came out for rolling out a uniform taxation regime in the country. In 2002 the Vajpayee government formed a task force under Vijay Kelkar to recommend tax reforms In 2005 the Kelkar committee recommended rolling out GST as suggested by the 12th Finance Commission.
After the defeat of the BJP-led NDA government in the 2004 Lok Sabha election and the election of a Congress-led UPA government the new Finance Minister P Chidambaram in February 2006 continued work on the same and proposed a GST rollout by 1 April 2010 however in 2011 with the Trinamool Congress routing CPI(M) out of power in West Bengal Asim Dasgupta resigned as the head of the GST committee Dasgupta admitted in an interview that 80% of the task had been done.
In the 2014 Lok Sabha election the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA government was elected into power with the consequential dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha the GST Bill â€“ approved by the standing committee for reintroduction  lapsed Seven months after the formation of the then Modi government the new Finance Minister Arun Jaitley introduced the GST Bill in the Lok Sabha where the BJP had a majority in February 2015 jaitley set another deadline of 1 April 2017 to implement GST In May 2016  the Lok Sabha passed the Constitution Amendment Bill paving way for GST however the Opposition led by the Congress demanded that the GST Bill be again sent back for review to the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha due to disagreements on several statements in the Bill relating to taxation finally in August 2016 the Amendment Bill was passed over the next 15 to 20 days 18 states ratified the Constitution amendment Bill and the President Pranab Mukherjee gave his assent to it.
A 21-member selected committee was formed to look into the proposed GST laws after GST Council approved the Central Goods and Services Tax Bill 2017 the CGST Bill the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Bill 2017 the IGST Bill the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax Bill 2017 The UTGST Bill the Goods and Services Tax Compensation to the States Bill 2017 The Compensation Bill these Bills were passed by the Lok Sabha on 29 March 2017. The Rajya Sabha passed these Bills on 6 April 2017 and were then enacted as Acts on 12 April 2017 thereafter State Legislatures of different States have passed respective State Goods and Services Tax Bills after the enactment of various GST laws Goods and Services Tax was launched all over India with effect from 1 July 2017 the Jammu and Kashmir state legislature passed its GST act on 7 July 2017 thereby ensuring that the entire nation is brought under an unified indirect taxation system there was to be no GST on the sale and purchase of securities that continues to be governed by Securities Transaction Tax STT.
IMPACT OF GST IN INDIA:
                                                    the Goods and Services Tax is defined as the giant indirect tax structure designed to support and enhances the economic growth of a country more than 150 countries have implemented GST so far  however the idea of GST in India was mooted by Vajpayee government in 2000 and the constitutional amendment for the same was passed by the Loksabha on 6th May 2015 but is yet to be ratified by the Rajya sabha. However there is a huge hue and cry against its implementation it would be interesting to understand why this proposed GST regime may hamper the growth and development of the country.
Amidst economic crisis across the globe india has posed as a beacon of hope with ambitious growth targets supported by slew of strategic missions like Make in India and Digital India etc. Goods and Services Tax GST is expected to provide the much needed stimulant for economic growth in India by transforming the existing basis of indirect taxation towards free flow of goods and services within the economy and also eliminating the cascading effect of tax on tax in view of the important role that India is expected to play in the world economy in the years to come the expectation of GST being introduced is high not only within the country but also in neighboring countries and in developed economies of the world.
The Goods and Services Tax GST is a vast concept that simplifies the giant tax structure by supporting and enhancing the economic growth of a country. GST is a comprehensive tax levy on manufacturing sale and consumption of goods and services at a national level the Goods and Services Tax Bill or GST Bill, also referred to as The Constitution one Hundred and Twenty-Second Amendment Bill 2014 initiates a Value added Tax to be implemented on a national level in India. GST will be an indirect tax at all the stages of production to bring about uniformity in the system.
On bringing GST into practice there would be amalgamation of Central and State taxes into a single tax payment It would also enhance the position of India in both domestic as well as international market at the consumer level GST would reduce the overall tax burden which is currently estimated at 25-30%.under this system the consumer pays the final tax but an efficient input tax credit system ensures that there is no cascading of taxes to tax on 
tax paid on inputs that go into manufacture of goods.
In order to avoid the payment of multiple taxes such as excise duty and service tax at Central level and VAT at the State level GST would unify these taxes and create a uniform market throughout the country. Integration of various taxes into a GST system will bring about an effective cross-utilization of credits the current system taxes production whereas the GST will aim to tax consumption.

EXPERT  HAVE ENLISTED THE BENEFITS OF GST AS UNDER:

                       *It would introduce two-tiered One-Country-One-Tax regime.
                       *It would subsume all indirect taxes at the center and the state level.
                       *It would not only widen the tax regime by covering goods and services but also make it transparent.
                       *It would free the manufacturing sector from cascading effect of taxes thus by improve the cost-competitiveness of goods and services.
                       *It would bring down the prices of goods and services and thus by increase consumption.
                       *It would create business-friendly environment thus by increase tax-GDP ratio.
                       *It would enhance the ease of doing business in India.

CURRENT TAX STRUTCTURE IN INDIA:
                          There are two types of tax in India direct tax and indirect tax a direct tax is a tax that is directly levied on a person and collected from the same person for example income tax on the other hand indirect tax is a tax that is indirectly collected Indirect tax is levied on one person and collected from another person for example sales tax.
We can also classify the tax structure in India on the basis of imposition some taxes are imposed by the central government and in some cases, states have sole power to levy and collect the tax For example, service tax, customs duty, and excise duty are levied and collected by the central government while value added tax, stamp duties, land revenues, and state excise taxes are levied and collected by the state government. People hire professionals to file taxes on their behalf a lot of tax-filing firms are present in the market but after the digitisation of all the filing processes it has become easier to get your work done.

CASCADING EFFECT IN CURRENT TAX STRUCTURE :
                                One of the main objectives of the new taxation regime is the avoidance of "taxation over taxes" or the cascading effect. Removal of a cascading effect is important to reduce deadweight loss i.e. a slump in a total surplus of supply the cascading is caused due to a levy of a variety of taxes by union and state governments some of which overlap it has raised the tax burden on Indian products because of which Indian products are not able to compete in the international market.

HOW WILL  GST REMOVE THE CASCADING EFFECT OF TAXES: 
                                GST will mitigate the cascading effect in a major way and will pave the way for a unified national market. This means that there will not be a â€œtax on taxâ€? situation which is currently applicable when goods are moved from one state to another.

BENEFITS OF GST:
                          The implementation of GST will help create a common market in India and reduce cascading effects of the tax on the cost of goods and services not only the tax but also the cost of goods and services may be affected in some sectors and there will be a boost in revenue multiple taxes like octroi central and state sales taxes and entry fees will no longer be present and all will be brought under the GST all in all we assume that life will only get simpler.

                       GST the biggest reform in Indiaâ€™s indirect tax structure since the economy began to be opened up 25 years ago at last looks set to become reality the Goods and Services Tax GST  the biggest reform in Indiaâ€™s indirect tax structure since the economy began to be opened up 25 years ago at last looks set to become reality the Constitution 122nd Amendment Bill comes up in Rajya Sabha today on the back of a broad political consensus and boosted by the â€˜good wishesâ€™ of the Congress which holds the crucial cards on its passage hereâ€™s how GST differs from the current regimes how it will work and
STAGE 1:
               Imagine a manufacturer of say shirts he buys raw material or inputs  cloth, thread, buttons, tailoring equipment  worth rs 100 a sum that includes a tax of rs 10 with these raw materials he manufactures a shirt In the process of creating the shirt the manufacturer adds value to the materials he started out with Let us take this value added by him to be rs 30. The gross value of his good would then be Rs 100 + 30 or Rs 130. At a tax rate of 10%, the tax on output this shirt will then be Rs 13. But under GST he can set off this tax rs 13 against the tax he has already paid on raw material/inputs rs 10. Therefore the effective GST incidence on the manufacturer is only Rs 3 (13 â€“ 10).
STAGE 2:
              The next stage is that of the good passing from the manufacturer to the wholesaler. The wholesaler purchases it for Rs 130 and adds on value which is basically his â€˜marginâ€™ of say rs 20. The gross value of the good he sells would then be Rs 130 + 20  or a total of Rs 150 a 10% tax on this amount will be Rs 15. But again under GST he can set off the tax on his output rs 15 against the tax on his purchased good from the manufacturer rs 13 Thus the effective GST incidence on the wholesaler is only Rs 2 (15 â€“ 13).
STAGE 3:
             In the final stage a retailer buys the shirt from the wholesaler to his purchase price of Rs 150 he adds value or margin of  say rs 10. The gross value of what he sells therefore goes up to Rs 150 + 10 or Rs 160. The tax on this at 10%, will be Rs 16. But by setting off this tax rs 16 against the tax on his purchase from the wholesaler rs 15 the retailer brings down the effective GST incidence on himself to Re 1 (16 â€“15). Thus the total GST on the entire value chain from the raw material/input suppliers who can claim no tax credit since they havenâ€™t purchased anything themselves through the manufacturer wholesaler and retailer is, Rs 10 + 3 +2 + 1, or Rs 16.

profile guests from the business and the entertainment industry including Ratan Tata it was boycotted by the opposition due to the predicted problems that it was bound to lead for the middle and lower class Indians The opposition used to call it GABBAR SINGH TAX and leader of the congress party Rahul Gandhi opposed it as strongly as he could It is one of the few midnight sessions that have been held by the parliament the others being the declaration of India's independence on 15 August 1947  and the silver and golden jubilees of that occasion After its launch the GST rates have been modified multiple times the latest being on 22 December 2018  where a panel of federal and state finance ministers decided to revise GST rates on 28 goods and 53 services.
Members of the Congress boycotted the GST launch altogether they were joined by members of the Trinamool Congress Communist Parties of India and the DMK. The parties reported that they found virtually no difference between the GST and the existing taxation system claiming that the government was trying to merely rebrand the current taxation system citation needed They also argued that the GST would increase existing rates on common daily goods while reducing rates on luxury items and affect many Indians adversely especially the middle lower middle and poorer income groups.
